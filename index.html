   <h1> 3 Key Takeaways for GenAI</h1>
  </header>
  
  <main>
<h1> Iteritive Process</h1>
<p>This week I learned about how writers when using Gen AI may have to adopt an iterative process when generating their subject matter, experimenting with phrasing, or refining their AI response. Responses to prompts, at first, may contain numerous inaccuracies or might not even 
  contain all the elements they wanted from their prompts, so users will have to develop over time both what they ask the AI, and, more practically, simply edit the AI themselves with their own knowledge of the subject matter or further research to correct the mistakes.
  Sometimes writers solely rely on refining AI with further prompts, which, while it can lead to eventually making something they want, this may cause one to repeatedly make additional prompts, further adding to their personal carbon footprint, just to eventually create something usable.
  When deciding if one should adjust their AI content, or if AI content ought not to be used, one needs to understand if their content is accurate, unbiased, complete in their information, relevant/useful to their given task, and consistent if prompted multiple times. AI generating different things after the same prompt is a key indicator that something may be wrong, 
  either with the prompt you are asking, or with the particular LLM's suitability to what you want to do.

<h1>Boost productivity for tasks</h1>
<p>This week I learned about ways AI can be used to speed up the work tech writers do. Tech writers can make AI more efficient if they use action verbs like "create" or "summarize" when wanting AI to do specific things. Asking AI to clarify that certain elements of the response should
  be defined or classified by key adjectives is also helpful to generate more detailed responses. Tech writers may ask to summarize longer documents or pieces of writing, so that they can understand key topics about a given subject without having to read through some more onerous texts. One may wonder, however, how much is 
lost when asking to summarize, and it may be difficult to check for accuracy when AI is detailing a text you did not read yourself. There is also a limit to how much one can possibly condense a piece of information when still being comprehensive, 
if, say, one attempts to summarize 3 pages of text into a single sentence, the AI may do its best to follow the task, but it may be near impossible to ascertain everything one needs. Beyond summaries, one can ask the AI to extract, or summarize, key pieces of data from a text, such as all mentions of X within a larger writing on a broader set of subjects.
One may need to check this for accuracy still, but it may be helpful to do this when wanting to retain a key piece of information from a document, which does not make said piece of information the main focus. One can also ask to turn the information into a table or ordered list in some way, saving some time for them. AI can also be used to translate text from one language to another. 
this is based on the languages of the texts used to train the AI, and can go into depth in doing this a different way than if one used google translate or a similar program when trying to understand information in a language one does not speak.

<h1>GitHub Pages and Semantic Elements</h1>
<p>This week I learned about how to create a web project via GitHub itself using the "Pages" option in settings. I learned what is needed to set up one's site with 
an index.html to initiate the overall function and a style sheet such as "web.css" to control the form/shape of the page in general. After deploying one's folder one can make updates to 
their files and refresh to see updates on their site. Editing the web.css can change the elements of the body such as the font, font size, and font family, which 
establishes both the font the writer wants to be in use, and alternatives fonts for the site to access incase certain ones are not installed within the system. Other 
semantic elements include background colors and text colors of one's sections. Although, link text is automatically colored blue by default, so one needs to change the "a" 
element for link color in order to change said text. I also learned about changing the padding space within, or margin spacing outside, a block element by either pixels, 
points or "em" to automatically match the size to an amount of lines of text.</p>

<h2> Conclusion </h2>
<p> In conclusion this week I learned how to set up an HTML site within GitHub itself, and utilize stylesheets to change the way elements behave with CSS. I learned how to add margins and
change sizes with pixels, points and line matching elements, and ensure the site can adapt to a usuable font with font families.</p>
